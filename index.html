                I like to think of myself as a <em>"knowledge sponge"</em>,
                soaking up knowledge from anywhere and anyone. I believe you can
                always learn something, even from the unlikeliest of places, if
                you are <em>open and willing to listen</em>. Frequently I find
                myself asking people within other disciplines questions and
                being able to apply it to my own.

                I'm always looking for ways to <em>improve</em> the efficiency
                of my work without compromising quality. I want there to be
                <em>as little friction as possible</em> between thinking of
                something and creating it. I'm constantly on the lookout for
                better software, workflows, and equipment. I plan out my work
                <em>diligently</em> to stay organized and efficient.

                Being able to solve problems is an <em>essential skill</em> for
                any programmer since that is basically what all coding is.
                <em>I've always enjoyed solving puzzles</em>, and when I became
                a shift manager, I really got to <em>hone</em> this skill. There
                were always results you could <em>improve</em>, whether it be
                cleanliness, speed, quality, etc... I would often spend my time
                <em>analyzing</em> the logistics of the restaurant to find
                <em>bottlenecks and solutions</em> to them.

                Most of all I'm a <em>doer</em>. If there is something I want to
                do, I will find a way to do it. If I need something done, I
                don't say "I can't do that", I say
                <em>"How do you do that and how do you do it well?"</em>. I
                research, I analyze, I implement, and I iterate. I never want to
                feel like I'm standing still, and I strive to be a
                <em>lifelong learner</em>.

                "John's presence was always a little bit intimidating in school
                before I got to know him, but the second we spoke I realized
                what an amazing and friendly person he was to have around!
                Always on top of his programming game and thorough pedagogical
                talent made him a well of knowledge during our time studying
                together. I could always count on John if there was a crazy and
                complex game mechanic I wanted implemented in our projects! Not
                only does John contribute with knowledge and good vibes, but his
                experience as a manager really shined through as an excellent
                scrum manager during our biggest project: "Moose Lost in the
                Woods". John will always be my favourite LinkedIn influencer and
                I can't think of a programmer who is more dependable to work
                with. This guy is the most disciplined person I have ever gotten
                the chance to work with and having him in your team is in my
                mind the closest you can get to guaranteed success."
