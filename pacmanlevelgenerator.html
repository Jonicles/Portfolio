              <p>
                A <em>level generator</em> for the arcade classic Pac-Man! With
                this project I wanted to challenge myself by exploring the
                <em>Wave Function Collapse algorithm</em>. I also tried to hone
                my skills in <em>time complexity</em> and make a efficient
                algorithm.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              I while back I had this idea of combining
              <em>Pac-Man with a roguelike setup</em>. This means that you must
              generate the levels somehow. I thought about it a lot and I
              couldn't come up with an easy solution. So naturally this excited
              me, and I started researching the topic.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              I found some other level generators for Pac-Man, particularly
              <a
                class="project-text-link"
                href="https://shaunlebron.github.io/pacman-mazegen/"
                target="_blank"
                >Shaun LeBron's generator</a
              >
              was of great inspiration. Although the generator was very
              sophisticated it felt a bit… <em>boring</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              The generated levels felt <em>too similar</em> to the original
              Pac-Man level and not very exciting. LeBron outlined some
              constraints that they found in the original Pac-Man level and Ms.
              Pac-Man levels. I decided to follow some of hese constraints while
              ignoring others to make the levels more exciting.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph"><em>Constraints I followed:</em></p>
            <ul class="project-bullet-list">
              <li>“Paths are only 1 tile thick.”</li>
              <li>“Intersections are separated by at least 2 tiles.”</li>
              <li>“No dead-ends.”</li>
              <li>
                This was never mentioned by LeBron, but the right side has to be
                a mirror of the left side.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              <em>Constraints I deliberately ignored:</em>
            </p>
            <ul class="project-bullet-list">
              <li>
                “Level is 28x31 tiles.” I wanted to have various sizes of the
                levels to create <em>more variation</em> (like a roguelike
                should).
              </li>
              <li>
                “There are 1 or 2 tunnels.” Although fun, I don't believe
                tunnels are necessary to capture the essence of Pac-Man.
              </li>
              <li>
                “Only I, L, T, or + wall shapes are allowed, including the
                occasional rectangular wall.” I think this is a bit restrictive,
                and we can create more exciting levels by ignoring this
                constraint!
              </li>
              <li>
                “Any non-rectangular wall pieces must only be 2 tiles thick.” We
                ignore this for the same reason as above! Instead, we will
                change it so that walls have to be at least 2 tiles thick for
                the sprites to work correctly.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              Having outlined a <em>plan</em>, we can now take a crack at the
              problem!

            <h3>TileGroups and TileShapes</h3>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              Originally, I fiddled around with loops and
              <em>random walks</em> to try and create the level. This proved to
              be unsuccessful. My algorithm would spit out levels that did not
              follow the constraints too well, it was hard to write them out in
              this way. I thought that there must be <em>another way</em>.
            </p>
            <img
              class="in-text-image"
              src="img/Pacman_Level_Generator/Pacman-Random_Walks.PNG"
              alt="Initial prototype"
            />
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              After staring at the original Pac-Man level for an unhealthy
              amount of time I started to notice <em>a pattern</em>. I decided
              to call it a <em>TileGroup, a group of 3x3 tiles</em>. The
              original Pac-Man level followed this pattern followed this pattern
              closely, only occasionally breaking from it. I thought it would do
              the trick! There is a finite amount of allowed shapes a group can
              take on.
            </p>

            />
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              If we put two of these groups next to each other there will always
              be two tiles between intersections! This became the base of how
              the levels were going to be cobbled together. The
              <a

              >
              does the cobbling and it is quite large, let's step through what
              it actually does!
            </p>

            <h3>Wave Function Collapse</h3>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              I had heard a bit about the
              <em>Wave Function Collapse algorithm</em> and thought it would fit
              my needs well. Particularly I foun
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://pvs-studio.com/en/blog/posts/csharp/1027/"
                class="project-text-link"
                >PVS-Studio's explanation</a
              >
              very helpful.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              We can simply create an <em>enum</em> with the
              <em>possible shapes</em>. Then each instance of the
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/Jonicles/Pacman_Level_Generator/blob/main/Pac-Rogue/Assets/Scripts/TileGroup.cs"
                class="project-text-link"
                >TileGroup class</a
              >
              can hold a list of the shapes available. Then when we perform the
              Wave Function Collapse algorithm, we can remove shapes that do not
              fit with the neighboring tiles.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              Now we need to define what shapes fit together with each other. To
              do this I created the static class called
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/Jonicles/Pacman_Level_Generator/blob/main/Pac-Rogue/Assets/Scripts/TileShapeRules.cs"
                class="project-text-link"
                >TileShapeRules</a
              >. The class keeps track of which shapes have and don't have a
              connection in each direction (north, east, south, west). In the
              class, we have a dictionary that has a Tuple of TileGroupShape and
              Direction as a key and
              <em>returns an array of shapes to remove</em> from the TileGroup
              instance.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              Now let's get to cobbling! When creating a new level, we need to
              translate the height and width into
              <em>how many TileGroups we need to fill the space</em>. If we want
              a level that is 28 tiles in width we can fit a maximum of 8
              groups, <em>3x8 = 27 tiles</em>. This means that we will not be
              able to fill the entire space, I address the solution to his the
              <em>Adding missing pellets section</em> but for now let's keep
              moving!
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              We only want to generate TileGroups for
              <em>half of the grid</em> since we will later <em>copy</em> over
              the tiles to the other side. Firs, we want to remove shapes from
              the TileGroups on the <em>border</em> of the grid. For example, we
              know that TileGroups on the west border need to remove all shapes
              that have a connection to the west side such as HorizontalLine,
              CornerSouthWest etc... and we get these shapes from
              TileShapeRules. Then per the
              <em>Wave Function Collapse algorithm</em>, we update the
              neighboring TileGroups.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              For each direction, we <em>compare</em> the shapes between the
              updated group vs the neighboring group. Using the TileShapeRules
              we look at the shapes to remove for the neighboring groups given
              the shape of the updated group. For example, if our updated group
              is the shape <em>“HorizontalLine”</em> and we are comparing the
              shapes to the north TileGroup we need to
              <em
                >remove all the shapes from that group that has a connection
                that goes south</em
              >
              (Plus, CornerDownLeft, VerticalLine etc…).
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              We must look at <em>all</em> the available shapes for the updated
              group. Then we will only remove the shapes for the neighboring
              group if that particular shape doesn't have a connection to any of
              the available shapes in that direction. Otherwise, we would be
              <em>assuming</em> that the updated group has a definite shape when
              it does <em>not</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              After removing shapes from the TileGroups on the border and
              updating their neighbors we will start to go through all the
              TileGroups <em>randomly</em>, set their definite shape to a random
              shape of those available, and update their neighboring groups
              until we have set a shape for <em>each</em> TileGroup. Now we got
              the base for our level!
            </p>

            <h3>Creating the TileGrid</h3>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              Now that we have set a definite shape for each TileGroup we can
              create <em>the full TileGrid</em>. TileShapeRules has a
              <em>definition</em>
              of every shape inthe form of a <em>bool array</em>, true
              represents a <em>pellet tile</em> and false represents a
              <em>wall tile</em>. For example, the empty shape will have an
              array full of falses. Using the definition for all the different
              TileGroups we create instances of the
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/Jonicles/Pacman_Level_Generator/blob/main/Pac-Rogue/Assets/Scripts/Tile.cs"
                class="project-text-link"
                >Tile class</a
              >
              and <em>transform their states</em> according to the
              TileShapeRules.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              Of course, this will only work for half of the grid. We copy each
              Tile's state from the left side over to the right side. The grid
              is now <em>perfectly</em> mirrored!
            </p>

            <h3>Ghost Box</h3>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              Now we need to place the <em>Ghost Box</em>. Originally, I had
              planned to use an <em>iterative method</em> to place the Ghost
              Box, but then I realized that the Ghost Box would look the same no
              matter what. So I made the
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/Jonicles/Pacman_Level_Generator/blob/main/Pac-Rogue/Assets/Scripts/GhostBox.cs"
                class="project-text-link"
                >Ghost Box Class</a
              >
              where each coordinate has a <em>definition</em> for what type of
              tile should be there. Then we set a start coordinate and iterate
              through all the coordinates needed and change the tiles to the
              defined tile in the <em>Ghost Box definition</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              Around the Ghost Box there is an <em>empty path</em>. I wanted the
              pellet path leading into this path to feel <em>natural</em>. In
              the Ghost Box definition, I added a two-tile thick border of wall
              tiles. Then I check for spots where I should
              <em>remove the wall tiles</em>. The way I do this is by checking
              in each direction if there is a line of two pellets in that same
              direction outside of the border. If there is, we will remove the
              wall separating the empty path and the pellet path.

            <h3>Adding missing pellets</h3>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              The level is not perfectly generated, several factors can
              contribute to a level that does not complete such as: the tile
              groups <em>do not fit</em> within the width of the level, the Wave
              Function Collapse algorithm might have
              <em>generated illegal connections</em> due to the order of
              generation, and the ghost box might have
              <em>removed neede tiles</em>. It might look something like this:
            </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph">
                To fix this we need to add pellets so there are
                <em>no incomplete paths</em>. To do this I will iterate over
                each tile in the grid and check its <em>Tile Code</em>. I
                determine the Tile Code by checking all the surrounding tiles.
                If a tile is occupied it will be represented by a <em>0</em>,
                otherwise it will be represented by a <em>1</em>. The indexes
                are as follows:
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph">
                Then I can look at the value and <em>compare</em> it to specific
                values represented by a <em>const string</em>. For example, if
                there is a tile with the <em>Tile Code “111110111”</em> it means
                that we should transform this tile into a pellet because it's a
                <em>dead end</em>. I check for a couple of specific cases and
                continue checking until there are no such cases left.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
              The Ghost Box and TileGroups not fitting in the full width might
              also cause another problem,
              <em>walls that are only 1 tile thick</em>. Since our tile sprites
              will not work with this type of <em>pattern</em> we have to do
              something else.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
              We use the tile's <em>Tile Code</em> to determine if the tile
              should be <em>set to empty</em> instead of occupied. This breaks
              the constraint of having paths that are only one tile thick. I
              think it's fine since the tiles are empty, but ideally, I would
              like to fix this <em>in the future</em>.

            <h3>Connecting paths</h3>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              We now run into our next problem. Since we have a TileGroup shape
              that is empty we might get
              <em>paths that are disconnected</em> from each other. This is
              obviously an <em>unplayable</em> level:
            </p>
            <img
              src="img/Pacman_Level_Generator/Pacman-Disconnected_Paths.PNG"
              alt="Disconnected paths"
              class="in-text-image"
            />
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              So we need to <em>connect the paths</em> somehow. The first
              challenge is <em>finding</em> the connected path. I iterate over
              the coordinates until we find a coordinate that isn't occupied,
              this is the start of the first path. We find all the connected
              coordinates to that coordinate using a <em>recursive</em> method
              that adds all neighboring coordinates that are pellets or empty to
              the connected coordinates. I specifically use a
              <em>Hashset</em> for this because
              <em>its Contains() method is an O(1) operation</em> and we will
              have to compare many coordinates many times.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              Now we want to continue iterating over the coordinates and try to
              find a coordinate that is a pellet or empty that is
              <em>not connected</em>
              to the previously fond coordinates. If we find a coordinate that
              matches this condition it means we have a
              <em>disconnected path</em>. Then we will find the coordinates for
              the disconnected path so we can pass them to a method and
              <em>connect the two paths</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              We are looking for a <em>specific type</em> of coordinate. The
              coordinate has to be on the edge of the path and it also has to be
              a coordinate that has once been the center of a TileGroup, which
              is why we make sure that we only look at the coordinates less than
              half of the grid. If a coordinate meets all these conditions, it
              means it's an <em>eligible coordinate</em> for a connection.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              Since the paths are entirely disconnected it would be good if we
              could connect it in <em>as many ways as possible</em>. For every
              eligible coordinate, we will check for the
              <em>closest possible connection</em> to the previous path. If
              there is no connection, we will do nothing. Otherwise, we will
              place pellets until we have gone the entire length which means we
              have now <em>connected</em> these paths. We will also place
              pellets on the mirrored coordinate.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              We will check for a connected path for as long as… well… the paths
              are <em>disconnected</em> from each other. We will also remove
              incorrect tiles after each iteration since they could create
              problems.

              So now we have our final level… <em>kinda</em>. See
              <em>I've been deceiving you, dear reader</em>, in the previous
              sections. For clarity, I made sure that this method was executed.
              In reality <em>this is what our level looks like right now</em>:
            </p>

            />
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              Now we need to actually
              <em>change the sprites into the right ones</em>. I made the
              singleton class
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/Jonicles/Pacman_Level_Generator/blob/main/Pac-Rogue/Assets/Scripts/TileSpriteHolder.cs"

                >TileSpriteHolder</a
              >
              that holds all the sprites. I also made an enum called
              <em>TileSprite</em>
              with a value for every kind of sprite. The class has one method
              called <em>GetSprite</em> and takes TileSprite as an argument and
              then <em>returns the corresponding sprite</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              I iterate over all tiles and if the tile is <em>occupied</em>, we
              will determine its Tile Code and then pass it to
              <em>TryGetTileSprite()</em>
              method. The method returns true if the Tile Code is a valid one
              and a <em>TileSprite as an out parameter</em>. Then we simply
              update the display of the tile with the new sprite.
            </p>

            <h3>Finding the border</h3>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              <em>Okay so we are not done quite yet</em>. In the original
              Pac-Man the levels have a border that is thicker than the border
              of wall tiles inside the level.
            </p>
            <img
              src="img/Pacman_Level_Generator/Pacman-Original_Level.png"
              alt="Original Pac-Man Level"
              class="in-text-image"
            />
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              I can't simply change the sprite based on the tile's Tile Code
              because
              <em
                >wall tiles within the maze might have the same Tile Code as a
                border tile</em
              >. So first of all we need to establish which tiles are on the
              border so we later can change their sprite into a border sprite.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              I began by simply iterating over the grid. If we are on the border
              of the Tile Matrix we will go in the opposite direction and try to
              find the first tile that does not have the Tile Code
              <em>“111111111”</em>, which means that the tile is entirely
              surrounded by other occupied tiles. <em>So to clarify</em>, if we
              for example are on the west border when iterating over the
              coordinates, we will begin iterating over all the coordinates in
              that row in the east direction until we find a coordinate that has
              a <em>pellet tile or empty tile</em> as a neighboring tile. That
              coordinate is then added as a <em>border coordinate</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              This will <em>almost</em> give us all border coordinates, but we
              are <em>far</em> from done. For example, these tiles will not have
              been added to the border coordinates (highlighted in red):
            </p>
            <img
              src="img/Pacman_Level_Generator/Pacman-Not_Found_Border.png"
              alt="Border coordinates not found"
              class="in-text-image"
            />
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              For each of the found border coordinates, we will try to find
              <em>additional coordinates</em> that are part of the border using
              the recursive <em>FindBorderCoordinates()</em> method. I will try
              checking the coordinate in each direction and if the coordinate is
              within the Tile Matrix, is not in the border coordinates, is
              occupied and does not have the Tile Code <em>“111111111”</em>, we
              will
              <em>add</em>
              it as a border coordinate and call the
              <em>FindBorderCoordinates()</em> for that coordinate.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              This will also help us get border coordinates that look like this
              (took a while to figure that one out):
            </p>
            <img

            <p class="project-paragraph">
              But we also have to be wary of something else.
              <em>Divots</em> (highlighted in red).
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
              <em>We do not want to add the divots to our border</em>. They
              stretch into the level and should only be one line thick. To solve
              this, I made a method called <em>CheckForDivot()</em>, depending
              on the Tile Code of the current coordinate I would check for
              divots in different directions. Basically, if any of the tiles in
              those particular directions had a particular Tile Code it would be
              divot.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              Then that direction will be <em>removed</em> from the
              <em>available directions</em> when checking for coordinates to add
              to the border
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              When we have found all possible border coordinates all we have to
              do is determine the <em>Tile Code</em> for each the coordinate and
              call <em>TryGetBorderSprite()</em>, which works pretty much
              exactly the same as the <em>TryGetTileSprite()</em>. The only
              difference is we also use the <em>CheckForDivot()</em> method to
              determine what sprite we should pick depending on the
              <em>divot direction</em>. Then all we have to do is update the
              tile's display with the new sprite!

            <h3>Shortcomings</h3>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              I wanted to make the maps <em>more dynamic</em> by being able to
              control their width and height. Due to the way Wave Function
              Collapse is implemented, levels may vary in size but it
              <em>isn't controllable</em>. Right now, the level is set to a
              28x31 grid no matter what, even though the level may be smaller
              than that. The Ghost Box created many problems when trying to
              change size, making <em>misaligned paths</em>. I would need to
              iterate more on its implementation to achieve better control.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              Now, I haven't implemented any ghosts, power pellets functionality
              and the actual game loop but, it is pretty apparent that some of
              the generated levels would be <em>very VERY hard to play</em>.
              Levels that have very <em>long paths</em> with no intersections or
              levels that technically don't lead to a <em>dead end</em> but in
              reality, is kind of a dead end.

              I think one solution could be making the algorithm
              <em>prioritizing</em>
              certain TileGroup Shapes over others or somehow
              <em>detecting</em> a long path and then trying to add more
              pellets.

            <h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              I got a much better understanding of procedural generation and the
              <em>Wave Function Collapse algorithm</em>. This has me excited to
              continue experimenting with it and trying to make more “designed”
              levels with a slew of randomness for a <em>better experience</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              I also learned more about <em>optimization</em>; it was very
              important for me that the levels could be generated quickly. I
              have now started to think much more <em>critically</em> about what
              data structures to choose.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
              I also learned to <em>not overcomplicate</em> when you don't have
              to. Sometimes you have to think about if what you are writing is
              too complicated for what it is you actually want to do. For
              example, with the <em>Ghost Box</em> where I tried an iterative
              approach and then realized that it would be much
              <em>easier and readable</em> if I just wrote out the exact
              definition for it.
