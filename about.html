            <h4>Who am I?</h4>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              I'm the guy who makes the funny little guys on the screen do
              stuff! All things game development <em>excites</em> me, but
              <em>programming</em> is what captured my heart.
            </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              My spark for game development started with rich level editors in
              other games. This led me to a
              <em>technical education</em> where I had the opportunity to create
              a game and showcase it to younger students. Seeing them play and
              enjoy it was an awesome feeling, I was <em>hooked</em>! After a
              2-year long stint as a shift manager, I started my
              <em>higher education in game design and scripting</em>. During my
              time there I have programmed and designed several games, one of
              which has won <em>"Best Narrative 2023"</em> and
              <em>"Gamers' Choice 2023"</em> at the Swedish Game Awards.
            </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              I have high ambitions and I try to bring my peers with me by
              sharing knowledge and resources, teaching concepts, and exuding
              <em>passion</em>. We can solve more problems more efficiently the
              more knowledgeable people are, and I want to
              <em>contribute</em> to that in any way I can. I think of myself as
              a <em>“knowledge sponge”</em>, soaking up knowledge from anywhere
              and anyone! This gives me <em>creative</em> problem-solving skills
              and makes it easier for other disciplines and fields to
              collaborate with me.
            </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              I'm most interested in <em>gameplay programming</em> and
              perfecting the moment-to-moment gameplay. I truly believe that
              <em>gameplay is king</em> and that the details matter. With that
              said, creating other kinds of systems for that gameplay to work is
              equally exciting!I want to help bring innovative ideas to life
              through <em>clever and effective implementation</em> that will
              really resonate with all kinds of players.
            </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              In the future, I would like to be someone that you can always turn
              to, someone who is around, and someone who
              <em>inspires</em>. I would love to be a <em>senior</em> game
              programmer or a <em>lead</em> game programmer one day to
              <em>mentor and cultivate future talent</em>. I want to be able to
              break down complex concepts and make them digestible and simple.

            <p class="about-paragraph">
              SPACE Academy wants to make tech and video games more
              <em>accessible</em>, <em>interesting</em>, and <em>fun</em> for
              everyone, especially the disenfranchised. My role was to
              <em>teach</em> our young students to take their first steps into
              the world of programming.
            </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              The students worked mostly independently and my responsibility was
              to <em>help the students</em> when they got stuck.
              <em>Interpersonal skills</em>
              were important to be able to adapt to the students' different
              needs. But most of all it was important to break down something
              that might seem <em>complex</em> into something that the students
              could <em>understand</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              It was thrilling to <em>share</em> my passion for programming with
              the students! Making someone understand how a computer interprets
              their instructions, why we must write code the way we do, and
              basics like how to use IntelliSense was <em>exhilarating</em>!

              I was mainly responsible for planning out the day so the
              restaurant could run smoothly. This involved a lot of
              <em>personnel management</em> and <em>delegating</em> tasks.
              Having an overview was a must to deal with any problems that could
              arise swiftly. <em>Solving problems</em> was a daily task, dealing
              with faulty machinery, angry customers and other conflicts. I took
              a lot of responsibility and pride in my work and became a
              <em>leader</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              I was good at <em>identifying bottlenecks</em> and spending time
              coming up with <em>solutions</em> for them. My free time was often
              spent analyzing the logistics of the restaurant. I would
              frequently get the green light from my superiors and
              <em>implement solutions</em> to great success.

            <p class="about-paragraph">
              During my time as a shift manager, my team and I helped Max
              Skellefteå - Solbacken become one of the
              <em>top performing</em> in the country. We received awards at the
              yearly gala called Ebba Awards for
              <em>best results in administration</em>
              with an accuracy of 96.26% and

              I have worked in 10 unique restaurants all around Sweden. I have
              helped during 4 openings of new restaurants by
              <em>teaching</em> new personnel and
              <em>establishing routines</em> and practices for a more
              sustainable, cleaner and quality-focused restaurant. I have been
              personally sent out on a mission to help out Max - Boden
              <em>analyze routines and patterns</em> to improve results in

              multiple games based on criteria, <em>analyzed</em> games from
